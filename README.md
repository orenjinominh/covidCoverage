# COVID COVERAGE USA #
  > A data visualization of relevant COVID-19 related statistics in the U.S, including the states of Alaska and Hawaii.

## Summary ##
  > Relevant statistics include:
    - Total number of COVID-19 related deaths per state, as recent as September 2020.
    - Deaths are broken down by race: White, Black, LatinX, Asian, NHPI, Multiracial, Other, or unknown.
    - Some states do not have complete data by racial breakdown and will state so on the state's modal.

## Problem ##
  > This application seeks to visualize for its users the COVID death rate among the US population, per state, per racial category.

## Solution ##
  > Users can click on each state of the SVG map of the United States in order to view state-specific COVID related data, and explore the breakdown of total deaths by race.


## How to Get Started ##
  > TBD
